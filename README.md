Hi thereðŸ‘‹

I am Hamed Markazi, an Economist and Econometrician with a demonstrated history of working in the research industry. Currently, I serve as a Lecturer and Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute of Labour Economics, Leibniz University Hannover, Germany.

In my current research, I employ causal machine learning methodologies to draw robust inferences from observational studies, leveraging high-dimensional individual-level databases.
